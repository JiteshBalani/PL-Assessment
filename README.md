   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

**Make sure you have Node.js installed on your local machine. You can check by running:**
   ```sh
   node -v
   ```
If Node.js is not installed, download and install it from: https://nodejs.org/en/download

3. **Install Dependencies**
   Since `node_modules` are ignored in version control, you need to install them using:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

Type 1: For a quick check, you can directly run the command below. 

   ```sh
   node index.js
   ```


Type 2: After installing the Dependencies, open the index.js file and change the arguments of the function called on line no. 148.


After the above is done, to run the project, use:
   ```sh
   node index.js
   ```
